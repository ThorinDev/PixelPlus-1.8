  Generally speaking, I'm very chill when it comes to code HOWEVER:
  Do not reuse code unless you're given explict permission. A good way to get one is to ask for it. A bad way to get one is to first reuse code and then, when I ask you to take it down, ask for permission.
  
  If you do reuse code with permission:
  1. Credit SirHuntPredator, Eladkay, and Farmer, the authors of the mod.
  2. Do not enter your code into any competitions, unless it's completely and absolutely unrelated to this mod. Generally speaking, asking is a good way to be sure. I reserve the right to ask you to take down code from competitions.
  3. Note that permission to reuse code is revokeable and personal. If I give Bob permission to use code, Bob's team can't use the code as a team, and vice versa.
  
  The authors of the mod reserve the right to take down a project that contains our code, with or without permission.
  We will hunt you down.
  You have been warned.
